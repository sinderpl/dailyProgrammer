/**
Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Assume that:

A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
A ≤ B.
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).

class Solution {
    public int solution(int A, int B, int K) {
        //Protect against divistion by zero
        if(K == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        else
        {
            if( A % K == 0)
            {
                return ( B / K ) - ( A / K ) + 1;
            }
            else
            {
                return ( B / K ) - ( A / K );
            }
        }
    }
}
